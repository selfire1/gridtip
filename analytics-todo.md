What I would like to know:

- How many people skip onboarding?
- How many select creating a new group?
  - How many of those abort/drop off?
- How many choose to join a group?
- How many go back on either of those options to select something else?
- How many users sign up through a group invitation?
- It's a bit involved currently to then have to sign up, to verify the email and to join the group. How many drop off in that group?
- What's the conversion rate like from the homepage to sign up?
- What's the conversion rate between signing up and having verified the email?
- See how many people join the global leaderboard
